# ~~SCRIPT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY ON Imagemagick 7.0.10-2 - 7.0.10-9~~
~~Download [Version 7.0.10-1](http://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/ImageMagick/binaries/ImageMagick-7.0.10-1-Q8-x64-static.exe) or older in order to make it work properly.~~ Works again in 7.0.10-9.

## osu-fontgen

Generates score fonts, combo fonts and/or circle (default) fonts based on options specified in script's header.
Documentation available at bottom of the script.

### How to use?

If you want to use it on Windows, you'll need to install [Git For Windows with Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows). If you install it
with default settings, you
should be able to just doubleclick the script and it'll do the work.

In order to change the settings, you will need to edit lines from line 26 to line 67. Explanation on what every line does and
how to set it is at the end of a file.

If you want to use it on Linux, you probably know what you're doing.

### Examples:

* Myprofile (Circle: Impact, Score: Source Code Pro, Combo: Caviar Dreams Bold)
